# ArcGIS Bookmarklets

A bookmarklet that enhances the ArcGIS REST query page with various quality-of-life changes.

* Field names are now selected via a multi-option select element rather than requiring the user to type a comma-separated list of field names that they have to look up themselves.
* Gives the user the option of not setting query parameters that they don't need.
  * Added "None" option to select elements (drop-downs) for non-required parameters. (E.g., "f" is a required parameter for the query, so it does not get a "None" option in its select element.)
  * Similarly, "true" and "false" radio buttons gain a third option which allows the user to leave the setting unset rather than be forced to choose a value.
* Adds a link to the top of the page that will clean-up the URL by removing search parameters from the URL that have no value.
* Submitting the form will now open the results in a new browser tab rather than replacing the current one.
* Adds a reset button to the form.
* Spatial Reference input changes (`outSR` and `inSR`)
  * Adds suggestions to the text input via [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) elements. Includes the following options. (Descriptions come from <https://epsg.io>.)
    * [4326]: "WGS 84 -- WGS84 - World Geodetic System 1984, used in GPS"
    * [3857]: "WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator -- Spherical Mercator, Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing, ArcGIS, ESRI"
    * [2927]: "NAD83(HARN) / Washington South (ftUS)"

## Future ideas

The following are ideas for enhancements that have not yet been implemented.

* Make it easier for users to specify geometry parameters
  * [ ] Allow them to select a point using [epsg.io's "Get position on a map" feature](https://epsg.io/map#srs=2927), which supports various SRs.
* [ ] Add [form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#validating_forms_using_javascript) using the [Constraint validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation).
  * We can't simply mark the `where` input control as required. While `where` is *usually* required for a query, but not *always*, depending on what other parameters the user has specified.
  * [ ] Validate geometry input is in the correct format.
